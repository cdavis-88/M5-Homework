                <h2>Coffee</h2>
                <p>While there are many different options for caffiene consumption, none are as wide-spread and well known as coffee is. Between it's rich taste, and the numerous mental and physical benefits that it offers, it's no wonder its such a hot comodity. For many other students, like myself it has gotten us throughnumerous late/sleepless nights of homework after coming home from a full day of school or work. While it definitely can become a source of dependancy, in moderation the good far outways the bad.</p>
